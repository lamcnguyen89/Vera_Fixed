    Thank you for responding to the request for volunteers for this study. 
    </p>
    <br/>
<p style={style.p}>Although many of us interact with digital media every day, undergraduates in non-computer science major may never have thought of designing interactive digital media. This study is for those students, who may want to try it out.  Our research team, which includes digital techies, social science and humanities teachers, invites you to participate in an online two hour workshop where you will learn some basic tools for designing and Interactive Digital Narrative (IDN), playing and commenting on a peer’s IDN, and offering some feedback to our research team about the process.</p>
    <br/>
    <p style={style.p}>You are being asked to participate in this research study because you have enrolled in your college subject pool or because you are enrolled in a social science course with interests in collaborative learning and related interaction processes. The purpose of this research study is to learn how undergraduates use an online platform for a two-hour workshop where you learn some basic IDN design tools, design your own IDN, and comment on a peer’s design. By participating in this study, you can contribute to research offering information about the digital media design education for non-computer science majors and information about player experiences when partners are from similar or different cultural and/or media backgrounds. </p>
    <br/>
    <p style={style.p}>The workshop is one that could occur in any number of social science or humanities courses where there’s an interest in uses of digital media for different kinds of collaborative learning and creative development. This research study will then, eventually, be available for use in higher education courses.</p>

<ul>
    <li style={style.li}>	If you agree to participate, we will ask you to do the following: follow a link we send taking you to a private online platform, where you can schedule your participation time, and proceed with the steps of the study. We will ask you to access the study from a computer in a private setting. Your participation will also be private in several other ways: we will ask you to select a pseudonym (fake name) so your participation is anonymous; complete a brief demographic questionnaire about your cultural identification and prior digital media use; use the IDN design/play platform to take a brief tutorial with an IDN design tool, use the tool to design an IDN. You will also be asked to offer and receive player experience reflections about the developing IDN designs. The researchers will assign peer design-play dyads (groups of two) based on information you put on the demographic questionnaire and the pretend name you suggest, not your actual name. At the end of the workshop, the platform system will present you with a brief exit survey to complete about your opinion workshop process and materials.  </li>
    <li style={style.li}>	Total participation time will be 2.5 hours, in one block, with a short personal break built in, and/or as needed, and if any of the study steps are completed ahead of time. </li>
    <li style={style.li}>	Minor risks to your participation may be that learning the IDN design tool is at first a little frustrating because it is new.  Should this occur, please be aware that we are not judging your ability to learn the tool but are interests how students share their experiences (with each other and with our team. There also exists the potential risk of the loss of confidentiality to the data collected. There are procedures in place to minimize this risk.</li>
    <li style={style.li}>	Benefits to you will be an opportunity to share your experience, which advocates and other helpers do not typically have a chance to do. Benefits may flow generally to the advocacy work for DACA candidates as the process is likely to continue to change over the next few years. </li>
    <li style={style.li}>	Participation will be compensated in terms of a course requirement (such as for Psych 100 research participation) or for extra credit from a social science professor. Participants volunteering through your college Psych 100 subject pool will receive full research participation credit for completing this 2.5 hour study (Hunter, CCNY, Brooklyn). Participants volunteering from a social science course will receive extra credit for completing the full 2.5 hour workshop and presenting the certificate of completion. You should contact your professor if you have questions about alternatives to participating in this project and wish to receive extra credit.</li>
    <li style={style.li}>	Your participation or nonparticipation in this study will in no way affect your grades, your academic standing with CUNY, or any other status in the College. There is also no obligation that you participate in this study; it is voluntary.</li>
    <li style={style.li}>	Should you choose to participate, all activities, including the IDN tutorial, IDN design, IDN play, and brief exit interview will all be conducted online (via internet connection), from your home or other location where you will have stable internet access. You will be instructed on how to access the program and will have access to ask questions of the research team, should you need to. </li>
    <li style={style.li}>	If you agree to participate, the research team will send you a link to access the study platform, via Zoom. If you complete and accept this consent form, you will then be able to access the online study. </li>
    <li style={style.li}>	Activities during the session will be recorded in the platform without your name or other personal identifiers. The research platform will prompt you to select a non-identifying pseudonym (pretend name) for yourself, and our platform system will then assign you a participant number, randomly so there will be no link between your activities and your name. Confidentiality will be maintained as your activities will be stored anonymously and not with your email or other contact information, necessary for our interaction.  We have kept your email address only for scheduling purposes and will delete it.</li>
    <li style={style.li}>	The online platform where you will do the study will store your completion of steps in the process (IDN designs) and the reflections you share with your peer. You will have the option to speak or write your reflections. Those comments are helpful to you as you/your peer work on your IDN designs and for the researchers to learn about IDN design peer collaboration. Any written, audio, or video during the study will be separated from your actual name, will be converted to codes (such as the kinds of suggestions you offer your peer), and deleted. </li>
  </ul>    
    <p style={style.p}>
      The information we collect from you as part of this study will not be used or distributed for future research.
